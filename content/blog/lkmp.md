## The Linux Kernel Mentorship

The [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) provides a [web portal](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/) with a set of tools allowing other organizations to conduct mentorship programs virtually. One notable offering is the "Linux Kernel Bug Fixing" mentorship, organized by the Linux Foundation itself. This program guides participants through the process of contributing to the Linux kernel, providing hands-on experience with one of the most important components of open-source software. It’s a great opportunity to gain technical knowledge and contribute to the Linux ecosystem under the guidance of experienced mentors.

## My journey
At the beginning of 2024, as I was wrapping up my Master’s Degree, I became interested in contributing to a significant open-source project. I had considered participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and found some interesting projects there. However, during one of my usual rabbit holes, I discovered something that excited me even more: the Linux kernel mentorship program. Without hesitation, I immediately applied. Although the mentorship was unpaid while GSoC offered stipends, working on the Linux kernel was by far more aligned with my interests.

## The application process
As part of the application process, I was given a series of tasks to demonstrate my ability to handle basic kernel development. These tasks were relatively straightforward, yet they were still challenging for someone with no prior experience in kernel programming. From printing “Hello World” from within the kernel and creating a simple kernel module to building and running the kernel on my own machine, and even sending some patches upstream. Already these tasks pushed me to explore new concepts and tools I wouldn’t have encountered otherwise (for example, I had no idea you could use Git to send emails). I also began to get a feel for the Linux development community, an environment that is incredibly meticulous and driven by precision.

## The mentorship
Once accepted into the mentorship, the structure is straightforward. The main goal is clear: get some patches successfully applied into the upstream kernel (at least five). The work is largely independent, with weekly meetings serving as check-ins with the mentors. These meetings typically consist of Q&A sessions where you can seek guidance, though it’s important to remember that even experienced kernel maintainers have varying levels of expertise depending on the subsystem. Occasionally, these meetings include guest speakers from the community who run workshops or share practical advice on kernel development. They cover topics like debugging techniques, effective log analysis, and other tips for spotting and fixing common flaws in the kernel. 

## A fact worth noting
A notable difference in the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program (LKMP) is the absence of a “concrete” goal compared to other mentorships. In programs like GSoC, participants typically work toward implementing specific features for a given project, ideally with a clear plan laid out from the start. In the LKMP, there isn’t a rigid objective or predetermined roadmap. This lack of direction can be challenging, especially when diving into something as complex as the Linux kernel without a clear path forward. However, this approach makes sense given the steep learning curve of kernel development. Rather than immediately tackling new features, the focus seems to be on integrating newcomers into the kernel community. While this structure can feel less guided, it’s a deliberate strategy aimed at easing contributors into the ecosystem. Rather than critiquing, this is a fact worth noting for the readers of this blog willing to apply to the mentorship.

## Conclusions
Overall, during this mentorship, I didn’t dive deeply into the core of the Linux kernel, nor did I expect to, as gaining a thorough understanding of the kernel requires significant time and patience. The learning curve is steep, with numerous caveats and a high level of complexity. It truly is a world of its own. However, I firmly believe that even working on relatively simple tasks in such an environment provides valuable learning opportunities. Every detail is scrutinized, and nothing is taken for granted, which has helped me develop a more rigorous approach to problem-solving. Although I didn’t fully grasp the core concepts of the kernel, I made meaningful progress in that direction—progress that would have been much harder to achieve without the support and guidance of this mentorship program. The skills and insights gained here are transferable and will undoubtedly be beneficial when contributing to other open-source projects.

In conclusion, the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program offers a great opportunity for anyone interested in exploring the world of kernel development. The experience is useful for gaining a clue of what working with the Linux kernel looks like. For those curious about this complex and fascinating field, applying to this mentorship is highly recommended. It’s a chance to immerse oneself in the kernel community, learn from experienced contributors, and gain insights that could shape future contributions to open-source projects.
