ROP emporium is a fantastic website providing some challenges to learn about **Return Oriented Programming**.

It has been sitting among my favorites in the toolbar, and while I'm currently seeking job opportunities, I decided that it's the right time ~~to prepare for the interviews~~ðŸ¤’ to go through those challenges and have a bit of fun while learning!
